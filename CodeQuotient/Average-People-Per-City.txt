Average people per city

The government has built a smart state with N cities, numbered from 1 to N, where each city has infinite capacity. Now the government wants to settle people in that state, and wants to complete the whole settling process in M phases. In each phase the government will choose 3 integers a, b and k, where, a and b are the city numbers, and k is the number of people to be added in each city whose number lies between a and b (both inclusive). Your task is to compute the average number of people settled per city, after M phases.
